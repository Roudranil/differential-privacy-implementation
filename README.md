# Steps taken till now:

1. Download the repository given in the link
2. Install `smartnoise-sql` as per docs [here](https://docs.smartnoise.org/).
3. I think I will first need to explore the data a bit and see what is going on in the first place.
4. Column names renamed in the zipcode dataset - spaces changed to underscore. This is done to ensure that the metadata in the smartnoise platform works well.

## TODO

1. Look at this [paper](https://github.com/microsoft/USBroadbandUsagePercentages/blob/master/assets/Broadband_usage_differential_privacy_paper.pdf) linked in the github readme.
2. Potential source for broad band usage data [github repo](https://github.com/MAPC/broadband-data)
